# Hangman (C and Python)

This repo will hold two Hangman implementations side by side:

- `c/` – C version
- `python/` – Python version

## C version (in `c/`)

Build and run with GCC:

```bash
gcc hangMan.c -o hangman
./hangman
```

On Windows PowerShell:

```powershell
gcc hangMan.c -o hangman
./hangman
```

## Python version (in `python/`)

I will later add my robust Python implementation under `python/` (e.g., `python/hangman.py`). A simple run command might be:

```bash
python hangman.py
```

## Repo notes

- Keep language-specific files in their folders.
- Add any per-language docs (e.g., `c/README.md`, `python/README.md`) if needed.
- Use branch or PR workflows as usual; branches are for changes, not for separating the languages.
